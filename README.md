# Obstacle-Dodger

A simple C++ game where a player-controlled ball must dodge obstacles descending from the top of the screen. The game ends when the ball collides with an obstacle, displaying the final score. Developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts as part of my journey at ITI.

# Features:
- Player controls a ball to avoid obstacles.
- Displays score upon game over.
- Reinforces OOP principles through design and implementation.
